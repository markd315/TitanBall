TargetSelector can take an Effect or a Runnable, maybe a cooldown too

if modifies entity variables in onActive (multiplicatively), make sure it restores them in onCease

Activator map that decodes keypres+titantype


Titan contains Ability[]

Ability(keycode, titantype, cooldown_id, Targeting, Effect):
constructor populates activator map
constructor populates effect map from id->impl class

this should allow us to "set and forget" abilities with the flow:
Activator is checked and tripped when processing client keys
Cooldown is checked and returned for validity
Selector is created and pool returned
pool reduced by any filters/limits
Any effects are created on the victims/targets
The ability goes back on cooldown

fix bug where ball can be taken on attacking away goalie
make ball taken by any collision with a goalie during intersect check


Colliders that persist for a duration and tear down. Tick mode and one-hit mode.
