To run with the launcher

```
java -jar Titanball-Launcher/getdown.jar Titanball-Launcher
```

IMPORTANT:
It is LIKELY that on Mac, your keylisteners will get stuck down occasionally. Symptoms of this include working mouse keybinds, but no working keyboard keybinds.
Run `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false` in a command-line to fix it permanently.

The client itself executes with the following code
```
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
java -cp Titanball.jar client.TitanballWindow
```

Or use the bash script
`./start.sh` (While in the folder with the jar and res folder)

I made the cage for the wolves myself, apparently it was too specific.
